**clinical_reports**:
{clinical_reports}


**Agent Instructions:**
Analyze the provided clinical_reports to determine if the patient has breast cancer.

1.  **Analyze Imaging Reports (Primary Focus):**
    * **Mammography (2D/3D - Tomosynthesis):**
        * Look for masses (irregular shape, spiculated margins, high density), architectural distortion, and calcifications (especially pleomorphic, fine linear branching calcifications).
        * Assess the BIRADS category (Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System) if provided (higher categories like BIRADS 4 or 5 are highly suspicious).
        * Note any associated skin thickening, nipple retraction, or axillary adenopathy.
    * **Breast Ultrasound:**
        * Evaluate any masses for solid vs. cystic nature, irregular shape, non-parallel orientation, angular margins, posterior acoustic shadowing, and abnormal vascularity on Doppler.
        * Look for suspicious axillary lymph nodes (loss of fatty hilum, rounded shape, cortical thickening).
        * Assess the BIRADS category.
    * **Breast MRI:**
        * Look for enhancing masses (especially those with rapid uptake and washout kinetics), non-mass enhancement (NME) with suspicious morphology (e.g., clustered ring enhancement, ductal enhancement), and diffusion restriction on DWI.
        * Assess for multifocality, multicentricity, or contralateral breast involvement.
        * Evaluate axillary lymph nodes.
        * Assess the BIRADS category.
    * **PET-CT (if available for staging):**
        * Look for FDG avid lesions in the breast or regional/distant metastatic sites.

2.  **Analyze Pathology Reports (Definitive Diagnosis):**
    * **Biopsy Reports (Core Needle Biopsy, Excisional Biopsy):** This is the definitive diagnostic tool.
        * Look for histological diagnosis of invasive carcinoma (e.g., invasive ductal carcinoma, invasive lobular carcinoma), ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), or other malignant epithelial neoplasms.
        * Note tumor grade (e.g., Nottingham grade).
        * Identify receptor status (Estrogen Receptor (ER), Progesterone Receptor (PR), HER2/neu) and Ki-67 proliferation index. These are crucial for subtyping and treatment planning.
        * Look for presence of lymphovascular invasion.
        * Note surgical margin status if an excision was performed.
    * **Lymph Node Biopsy/Dissection Reports:**
        * Indicate the presence or absence of metastatic carcinoma in lymph nodes and the number of positive nodes.

3.  **Analyze Relevant Laboratory Tests (Supportive/Staging):**
    * **Blood tests (e.g., CBC, LFTs, Calcium):** May reveal signs of systemic disease or metastatic spread (e.g., elevated LFTs for liver mets, hypercalcemia for bone mets, anemia).
    * **Tumor Markers (e.g., CA 15-3, CA 27-29, CEA):** While not diagnostic, these can be elevated in advanced breast cancer and used for monitoring.

4.  **Cross-reference and Synthesize:**
    * Integrate findings from imaging, which identifies suspicious lesions, with pathology, which provides the definitive diagnosis and characterizes the tumor.
    * Consider the overall clinical picture and staging information if available.

5.  **Google Search Tool Usage:**
    * If you encounter any unfamiliar medical terms (e.g., specific BIRADS classifications, histological subtypes like "invasive ductal carcinoma not otherwise specified," terms related to receptor status like "ER positive, HER2 negative"), imaging characteristics (e.g., "spiculated margins," "washout kinetics"), or grading systems, use the `Google Search` tool to clarify their meaning and clinical significance in the context of breast cancer.

**clinical_reports**:
{clinical_reports}


**Agent Instructions:**
Analyze the provided clinical_reports to determine if the patient has colon cancer.

1.  **Analyze Endoscopy Reports (Crucial for Initial Detection and Biopsy):**
    * **Colonoscopy/Sigmoidoscopy Reports:**
        * Look for the presence, size, location (e.g., cecum, ascending colon, transverse colon, descending colon, sigmoid colon, rectum), and characteristics of any polyps or masses.
        * Note descriptions of lesions: sessile, pedunculated, ulcerated, fungating, circumferential, friable, stricturing.
        * Identify any areas of mucosal irregularity, inflammation, or bleeding that are suspicious.
        * Confirm if biopsies were taken from suspicious areas.

2.  **Analyze Pathology Reports (Definitive Diagnosis):**
    * **Biopsy Reports (from endoscopy):** This is the definitive diagnostic tool.
        * Look for histological diagnosis of adenocarcinoma (most common type of colon cancer), or other malignant epithelial neoplasms.
        * Note tumor differentiation (e.g., well, moderately, poorly differentiated).
        * Identify presence of high-grade dysplasia or carcinoma in situ in polyps, which are pre-malignant conditions that may indicate a high risk of progression or already harbor invasive cancer.
    * **Surgical Resection Specimen Reports (if surgery performed):**
        * Confirm the diagnosis of adenocarcinoma.
        * Note tumor size, depth of invasion (e.g., into submucosa, muscularis propria, serosa, or beyond).
        * Assess for lymph node involvement (number of positive lymph nodes out of total examined).
        * Look for perineural invasion, lymphovascular invasion.
        * Determine proximal and distal surgical margins.
        * Note TNM staging (Tumor, Node, Metastasis) if provided.

3.  **Analyze Imaging Reports (For Staging and Metastasis):**

        * Look for evidence of a primary colon mass (e.g., bowel wall thickening, luminal narrowing).
        * Assess for regional lymphadenopathy.
        * Identify distant metastases, particularly in the liver, lungs, peritoneum (ascites, omental caking), or ovaries.
        * Look for signs of obstruction or perforation.
    * **MRI (for rectal cancer staging):**
        * Provides detailed local staging for rectal tumors, assessing depth of invasion into the bowel wall and involvement of pelvic organs/fascia.
    * **PET-CT (if available for staging):**
        * Look for FDG avid lesions in the colon or at metastatic sites.
    * **Chest X-ray/CT Chest:**
        * For pulmonary metastases.

4.  **Analyze Relevant Laboratory Tests (Supportive/Monitoring):**
    * **Complete Blood Count (CBC):**
        * Look for iron deficiency anemia (common due to chronic blood loss from the tumor).
    * **Liver Function Tests (LFTs):**
        * Assess for abnormalities that could indicate liver metastasis.
    * **Carcinoembryonic Antigen (CEA) Tumor Marker:**
        * While not diagnostic, elevated CEA levels can be associated with colon cancer, especially advanced stages, and are used for monitoring recurrence after treatment.
    * **Fecal Immunochemical Test (FIT) / Stool DNA Test:**
        * While screening tests, a positive result indicates the need for further investigation and increases suspicion.

5.  **Cross-reference and Synthesize:**
    * Integrate findings from endoscopy (visualizing the lesion), pathology (confirming malignancy), and imaging (for staging and metastasis).
    * Consider the overall clinical picture, including any reported symptoms like changes in bowel habits, rectal bleeding, abdominal pain, or unexplained weight loss, if implicitly mentioned.

6.  **Google Search Tool Usage:**
    * If you encounter any unfamiliar medical terms (e.g., specific polyp morphologies, histological grades, TNM staging classifications like "T3N1M0"), imaging characteristics (e.g., "omental caking," "apple-core lesion"), or tumor marker interpretations, use the `Google Search` tool to clarify their meaning and clinical significance in the context of colon cancer.

{clinical_reports}


**Agent Instructions:**
Analyze the provided clinical_reports to determine if the patient has brain cancer.

1.  **Analyze Imaging Reports (Primary Focus):**
    * **Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the Brain (with and without contrast):** This is the most sensitive and specific imaging modality for brain tumors.
        * Look for the presence of intracranial masses or lesions.
        * Assess characteristics: size, shape, location (e.g., supratentorial, infratentorial, specific lobe), enhancement patterns (e.g., ring enhancement, homogeneous, heterogeneous, no enhancement), presence of edema (vasogenic or cytotoxic), mass effect (midline shift, effacement of sulci/ventricles), and hemorrhage.
        * Evaluate diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) for restricted diffusion (common in high-grade tumors/abscesses).
        * Note findings on MR spectroscopy (MRS) if available (e.g., elevated choline-to-creatine ratio, reduced NAA, presence of lactate/lipids).
        * Look for involvement of meninges, ventricles, or spinal cord.
    * **Computed Tomography (CT) Scan of the Brain (with and without contrast):**
        * Look for masses, peritumoral edema, calcifications, hemorrhage, and mass effect.
        * CT is less sensitive than MRI but useful for emergency situations or detecting calcifications/hemorrhage.
    * **PET-CT/PET-MRI (if available, e.g., using FDG or specific tracers like methionine, choline):**
        * Look for metabolically active lesions in the brain and evaluate for extracranial primary cancer if metastatic brain tumor is suspected.

2.  **Analyze Pathology Reports (Definitive Diagnosis):**
    * **Biopsy Reports (Stereotactic Biopsy, Open Craniotomy with Resection):** This is the definitive diagnostic tool.
        * Look for histological diagnosis of primary brain tumors (e.g., glioblastoma, astrocytoma, oligodendroglioma, meningioma, schwannoma, medulloblastoma, ependymoma) or metastatic carcinoma/melanoma/lymphoma.
        * Note tumor grade (e.g., WHO grades I-IV for gliomas).
        * Identify molecular markers (e.g., IDH mutation, 1p/19q co-deletion, MGMT promoter methylation, EGFR amplification, TERT promoter mutation, BRAF V600E mutation) which are critical for classification, prognosis, and treatment.
        * Look for mitotic activity, microvascular proliferation, and necrosis.

3.  **Analyze Relevant Laboratory Tests (Supportive Information/Ruling out mimics):**
    * **CSF Analysis (if performed):**
        * Look for malignant cells (cytology), elevated protein, or low glucose in leptomeningeal carcinomatosis.
    * **Tumor Markers (e.g., AFP, beta-hCG for germ cell tumors; PSA for prostate, CEA for colon, CA 125 for ovarian, etc., if a primary cancer is suspected as the source of brain metastasis):**
        * May support the diagnosis of metastatic brain cancer.
    * **Blood tests for infection/inflammation:**
        * Rule out infectious processes (e.g., brain abscess, toxoplasmosis) that can mimic tumors on imaging.

4.  **Cross-reference and Synthesize:**
    * Integrate findings from imaging (localizing and characterizing the lesion), pathology (providing the definitive diagnosis and molecular profile), and supportive laboratory tests.
    * Consider the clinical context if implicitly mentioned (e.g., new onset seizures, focal neurological deficits, headaches, cognitive changes).

5.  **Google Search Tool Usage:**
    * If you encounter any unfamiliar medical terms (e.g., specific MRI sequences like "FLAIR," "DWI," "MRS metabolite ratios," histological types like "glioblastoma multiforme," specific molecular markers like "IDH-mutant astrocytoma"), imaging characteristics (e.g., "ring-enhancing lesion," "mass effect," "leptomeningeal enhancement"), or WHO grading criteria for brain tumors, use the `Google Search` tool to clarify their meaning and clinical significance in the context of brain cancer.
