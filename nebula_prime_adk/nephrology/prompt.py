{clinical_reports}


**Agent Instructions:**
Analyze the provided clinical_reports to determine if the patient has nephrolithiasis (also known as 'kidney stones' or 'urolithiasis').

1.  **Analyze Radiology Reports (Primary Focus):**
    * **Computed Tomography (CT) KUB (Kidneys, Ureters, Bladder) without contrast:** This is the gold standard for detecting kidney stones.
        * Look for discrete, hyperdense (bright white) foci within the renal collecting system, ureters, or bladder.
        * Note the size, number, and exact location (e.g., renal calyx, renal pelvis, proximal/mid/distal ureter, ureterovesical junction) of any identified stones.
        * Assess for associated findings such as hydronephrosis (dilation of the renal collecting system proximal to an obstructing stone) or hydroureter.
        * Look for perinephric stranding (inflammation around the kidney).
    * **Kidney Ultrasound:**
        * Look for echogenic (bright) foci with posterior acoustic shadowing within the kidneys or proximal ureters.
        * Assess for hydronephrosis.
        * Note that ultrasound may miss smaller stones, especially in the ureters.
    * **X-ray KUB:**
        * Look for radiopaque (white) densities in the expected location of the kidneys, ureters, or bladder.
        * Note that many common stone types (e.g., uric acid stones) are radiolucent and may not be visible on X-ray.

2.  **Analyze Laboratory Tests (Supportive Information):**
    * **Urinalysis:**
        * Look for hematuria (blood in urine), either macroscopic or microscopic. This is a common finding with kidney stones.
        * Check for signs of infection (pyuria - white blood cells in urine, positive leukocyte esterase, nitrites) which can complicate kidney stones.
        * Note urine pH, as certain stone types form in specific pH ranges.
        * Look for crystalluria (presence of crystals in the urine sediment), although this is not definitive for stones.
    * **Complete Blood Count (CBC):**
        * Look for leukocytosis (elevated white blood cell count) if there is an associated infection.
    * **Serum Creatinine/BUN:**
        * Assess renal function, especially if there is evidence of obstruction affecting kidney function.
    * **Electrolyte/Calcium/Phosphate/Uric Acid levels (if stone analysis or metabolic workup is included):**
        * May provide clues about the type of stone (e.g., elevated calcium in hyperparathyroidism, elevated uric acid in gout/uric acid stones).

3.  **Cross-reference and Synthesize:**
    * Integrate findings from radiology reports, which are crucial for stone detection, with supportive laboratory findings, especially those indicating complications like infection or obstruction.
    * Consider the patient's symptoms if implicitly mentioned in the reports (e.g., flank pain, dysuria).

4.  **Google Search Tool Usage:**
    * If you encounter any unfamiliar medical terms (e.g., specific imaging descriptors like "hydronephrosis grade," "acoustic shadowing"), types of kidney stones (e.g., calcium oxalate, uric acid), or assessment criteria for stone size and location in relation to clinical management, use the `Google Search` tool to clarify their meaning and clinical significance in the context of nephrolithiasis.

**clinical_reports**:
{clinical_reports}


**Agent Instructions:**
Analyze the provided clinical_reports to determine if the patient has renal failure (also known as 'kidney failure').

1.  **Analyze Laboratory Tests:**
    * Look for elevated levels of serum creatinine.
    * Look for elevated levels of blood urea nitrogen (BUN).
    * Assess the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). A significantly decreased eGFR (typically below 15 mL/min/1.73 m² for end-stage renal disease, or persistently below 60 mL/min/1.73 m² for chronic kidney disease) is a key indicator.
    * Check for electrolyte imbalances, such as elevated potassium (hyperkalemia), elevated phosphate (hyperphosphatemia), and decreased calcium (hypocalcemia).
    * Look for signs of anemia (low hemoglobin and hematocrit), which is common in chronic kidney failure.
    * Examine urinalysis results for proteinuria (excess protein in urine), hematuria (blood in urine), and casts.

2.  **Analyze Radiology Reports:**
    * Look for imaging findings indicative of kidney size and structure. Small, shrunken kidneys often suggest chronic kidney disease. Enlarged kidneys may indicate acute kidney injury or certain underlying conditions like polycystic kidney disease.
    * Identify signs of hydronephrosis (swelling of a kidney due to a backup of urine) which could indicate an obstruction.
    * Note any evidence of kidney stones or other structural abnormalities.
    * Look for reports of renal artery stenosis.

3.  **Cross-reference and Synthesize:**
    * Integrate findings from both laboratory tests and radiology reports to form a comprehensive assessment.
    * Consider the temporal aspect of findings (acute vs. chronic changes).

4.  **Google Search Tool Usage:**
    * If you encounter any unfamiliar medical terms, lab values, or assessment criteria, use the `Google Search` tool to clarify their meaning and clinical significance in the context of kidney failure. For example, if a specific eGFR formula or a particular type of renal imaging finding is mentioned, use `Google Search` to understand its implications.

**clinical_reports**:
{clinical_reports}


**Agent Instructions:**
Analyze the provided clinical_reports to determine if the patient has renal cell carcinoma (RCC) which is the most common type of kidney cancer.

1.  **Analyze Radiology Reports (Primary Focus):**
    * **Computed Tomography (CT) Scans (Abdomen/Pelvis with and without contrast):**
        * Look for the presence of renal masses or lesions.
        * Assess the size, shape, and enhancement characteristics (heterogeneous enhancement, areas of necrosis/cyst formation) of any detected masses.
        * Note any involvement of the renal vein or inferior vena cava (tumor thrombus).
        * Look for evidence of local invasion into surrounding fat or adjacent organs.
        * Check for regional lymphadenopathy (enlarged lymph nodes).
        * Identify any distant metastases, particularly in the lungs, bone, liver, or adrenal glands.
    * **Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the Abdomen/Pelvis:**
        * Similar to CT, evaluate renal masses for their signal characteristics on various sequences (T1, T2, fat-saturated, diffusion-weighted imaging).
        * Assess for venous involvement and local extension.
    * **Ultrasound (Renal):**
        * Look for solid renal masses.
        * Note any findings of vascularity within the mass on Doppler ultrasound.
        * While less definitive than CT/MRI for characterization, ultrasound can be the initial detection method.
    * **Bone Scans/PET Scans:**
        * If available, evaluate for metastatic disease.

2.  **Analyze Laboratory Tests (Supportive Information):**
    * **Complete Blood Count (CBC):** Look for anemia (common due to chronic bleeding or paraneoplastic syndromes) or erythrocytosis (elevated red blood cell count, due to increased erythropoietin production by the tumor).
    * **Liver Function Tests (LFTs):** Assess for abnormalities that could indicate liver metastasis or paraneoplastic syndromes (e.g., Stauffer's syndrome).
    * **Calcium Levels:** Look for hypercalcemia, which can be a paraneoplastic syndrome.
    * **Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR) / C-reactive protein (CRP):** May be elevated in inflammatory processes associated with malignancy.
    * **Renal Function Tests (Creatinine, BUN, eGFR):** While not directly indicative of RCC, assess overall kidney function, especially if a nephrectomy is considered.

3.  **Cross-reference and Synthesize:**
    * Integrate findings from radiology reports, which are the primary diagnostic tool for RCC, with supportive laboratory findings.
    * Consider the overall clinical picture suggested by the reports.

4.  **Google Search Tool Usage:**
    * If you encounter any unfamiliar medical terms (e.g., specific imaging descriptors like "heterogeneous enhancement," "tumor thrombus"), types of renal masses (e.g., oncocytoma vs. RCC characteristics), or assessment criteria for RCC staging, use the `Google Search` tool to clarify their meaning and clinical significance in the context of renal cell carcinoma.
